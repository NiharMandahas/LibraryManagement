# LibraryManagement


C++ Library Management System Project
This project will help you learn and practice all core OOP concepts while building something useful. Here's a detailed breakdown:
Phase 1: Core Classes and Basic Functionality

Create the base classes:

LibraryItem (abstract base class)
Book, Magazine, DVD (derived classes)
User class for library members
Transaction class for checkouts/returns


Implement basic attributes and methods:

Design appropriate constructors, getters, and setters
Implement proper encapsulation (private data, public interfaces)
Add validation logic for data integrity



Phase 2: Relationships and Advanced OOP

Implement inheritance relationships:

Single inheritance: LibraryItem â†’ Book/Magazine/DVD
Multiple inheritance: Create a ReferenceBook that inherits from Book and a new NonCirculating interface


Add polymorphism:

Virtual functions in LibraryItem (like calculateLateFee(), display())
Override these in derived classes with specific implementations


Incorporate abstraction and interfaces:

Create abstract methods in LibraryItem
Design interfaces like ISearchable, IBorrowable



Phase 3: Advanced Features and Error Handling

Implement exception handling:

Create custom exception classes (ItemNotFoundException, UserNotAuthorizedException)
Use try/catch blocks appropriately
Handle common errors gracefully


Add templates and STL:

Create a generic Catalog<T> template class
Use STL containers (vector, map) to store collections


Implement operator overloading:

Overload comparison operators to compare library items
Overload stream operators for easy output



Phase 4: System Integration

Create the Library Management System class:

Implement search functionality
Add checkout/return processes
Create reporting features


Add persistence:

Implement file I/O for data storage
Consider using serialization
